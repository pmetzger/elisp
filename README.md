This is a set of a few emacs hacks I've found useful. Some I've
written, some are modified versions of other people's.

The smaller ones of my own are public domain -- they're too small to
actually copyright.

The larger ones of my own are labeled with their license.

<dl>

<dt>timestamp.el:</dt>
<dd>Trivial code for inserting a timestamp into the current buffer.<dd>

<dt>unbound.el:</dt>
<dd>Shows you what keys are not bound by emacs, so you can find
free key combinations for bindings for your own code. I changed it to
sort the output.</dd>
