This is a set of a few emacs hacks I've found useful. Some I've
written, some are modified versions of other people's.

The smaller ones of my own are public domain -- they're too small to
actually copyright.

The larger ones of my own are labeled with their license.

timestamp.el: Trivial code for inserting a timestamp into the current buffer

unbound.el: Slightly improved code for seeing what keys are not bound,
so you can find bindings for your own code. I changed it to sort the
output.
